# my-learning-zynq
Zynq tutorials, example code, notes.   Very basic getting started materials.

Includes copies of some public domain Zynq material courtesy of http://www.zynqbook.com/download-tuts.html to prevent me having to locate and download this useful material repeatedly from different development boxes.

## Pynq

Pynq is python plus zynq.  Some notes on getting started, particularly using
a Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 board.
