# my-learning-zynq
Zynq tutorials, example code, notes.   Very basic getting started materials.

Includes copies of some public domain Zynq material courtesy of http://www.zynqbook.com/download-tuts.html to prevent me having to locate and download this useful material repeatedly from different development boxes.

## Pynq

Pynq is python plus zynq.  Some notes on getting started, particularly using
a Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 board.

## Pynq Side Benefits

The pynq tutorial includes some nice use of the [wavedrom](https://wavedrom.com/tutorial.html) javascript digital waveform
plotting library.   This is excellent for rendering digital timing diagrams with good annotation support.

See also the 'wavedrom_tutorial' provided with the ipython notebook from the pynq 2.6 notebook examples.

## Diary 

### 2024-01-03

Running the logictools demonstrations to get a feel for what can be done to verify example code on 
a single board (use of digital loopback and also linking arduino GPIO output pins together).
